## **Key Insights**  
- **Top‑Paid Roles:** *Head of Data* & *AI Product Managers* earn up to **$220K**.  
- **Geographic Premium:** US salaries are **26% higher than Canada** and **89% higher than Great Britain**.  
- **Seniority Gap:** Executives earn nearly **2× more than entry‑level roles**.  
- **Most Common Role:** *Data Scientist* remains the most in‑demand AI & Data position globally.  

---

## **Key Strategic Insights**
- **Seniority & specialization drive pay:** Executive roles and niche technical positions (e.g., *Head of Data*, *AI Product Manager*) command the highest salaries.  
- **Data roles dominate:** *Data Scientist*, *Software Engineer*, and *Data Engineer* are the most common in‑office positions.  
- **Company size matters:** Large companies pay higher median salaries, but medium‑sized firms make up most of the market.  
- **US leads compensation:** US roles pay substantially more than Canada and Great Britain at median.  
- **Stable groups improve reliability:** Analyses are based on market segments with ≥3 responses to ensure trustworthy insights.  

---

## **Recommendations**
- **For jobseekers:** Target executive and specialist roles for top compensation; use these benchmarks in salary negotiations.  
- **For employers:** Benchmark against US compensation for competitive global offers; focus on retention of senior and specialized talent.  
- **For analysts:** Use “stable group” medians for workforce planning and budgeting; avoid relying on single‑response outliers.  

---

## **Limitations & Next Steps**
- Data is filtered to **in‑office, full‑time roles** in **US, CA, GB** only.  
- Excludes **remote and hybrid positions**, which may pay differently.  
- Relies on **self‑reported salary data**, which may contain reporting bias.  
- Use of **stable groups (n ≥3)** improves reliability but excludes some niche or emerging roles with insufficient data.  

**Further analysis could include:**  
- Year‑over‑year salary trends  
- Remote vs. in‑office pay comparisons  
- Industry‑specific breakdowns  
- Expanded geographic coverage
